===== Program Specs =====
This program finds a path on a 7x7 board that starts from a start state and travels to every position on the board. The program uses a depth-first-search to select the next position to move to. The program utilizes a closed list, which contains all the board positions that have been visited. It also utilizes an open-list, which contains all the board positions which the game piece may legally move to from its current position. The program calls a recursive function called "giraffe" which selects a position to move to until there are no more possible legal moves. The program finds a path that successfully travels to all 49 board positions.
