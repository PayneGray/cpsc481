Program description:
This program generates a tree of expressions and through a series of generations, cross children and mutations, runs fitness tests accordingly to find a generated child that is the most healthy toward our data set. We have several functions to complete this task. We have generate expresssions, fitness tests, cross over point, cross children, and mutate. These all run in a main file that will run 50 times, once for each generation, in order to best find our healthiest child.
