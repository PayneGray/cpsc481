Program description:
This program generates up to 50 ants at once that will navigate through an obstacle or maze to find food. Once one ant finds food,
he drops a scent trail on the way back home. When other ants come across the scent trail, they will no where to go. With each 
iteration of the ants along the path, it will become more and more optimized until finally there's just a stream of ants in the best
possible path, heading straight toward the food and back.
